Internet Chess Servers allow people to find and play opponents worldwide. The presence of computers and modern communication tools have raised concerns regarding cheating during games.[187] 

# Related games 

Related games include: 

direct predecessors of chess, such as chaturanga and shatranj; 

traditional national or regional games that share common ancestors with Western chess such as xiangqi 

(Chinese chess), shogi (Japanese chess), janggi (Korean chess), ouk chatrang (Cambodian chess), makruk 

(Thai chess), sittuyin (Burmese chess), and shatar (Mongolian chess); 

In the comparison of chess with games often referred to as national forms of chess, chess may be referred to as Western chess or international chess.[188][189] 

## Chess variants

modern variations employing different rules (e.g. losing chess and Chess960[note 8]), different forces (e.g. Dunsany's chess), non-standard pieces (e.g. Grand Chess), and different board geometries (e.g. hexagonal chess and infinite chess); 

In the context of chess variants, chess is commonly referred to as orthodox chess, orthochess, and classic chess.[188][189]

* 3. At that time the Spanish word would have been written axedrez. The Spanish "x" was pronounced as English "sh", as the Portuguese "x" 

still is today. The spelling of ajedrez changed after Spanish lost the 

"sh" sound.
* 4. The allegorical poem Scachs d'amor, the first to describe a modern game, is probably from 1475.[71][72]
* 5. This is stated in The Encyclopaedia of Chess (1970, p. 223) by Anne Sunnucks, but is disputed by Edward Winter (chess historian) in his 

Chess Notes 5144 and 5152 (http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/wint

* 6. Chess is even called the "drosophila" of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence (AI) studies, because it represents the domain in 

which expert performance has been most intensively studied and 

measured.[149]
* 7. Alan Turing made an attempt in 1953.[177]
* 8. In 2008 FIDE added Chess960 rules to an appendix of the Handbook.[192] This section is now classified under "Guidelines",[2] 

indicating that the rules presented do not have the weight of FIDE law.
