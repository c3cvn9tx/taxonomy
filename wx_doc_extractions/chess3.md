Tournaments and matches 

Contemporary chess is an organized sport with structured international and national leagues, tournaments, and congresses. Thousands of chess tournaments, matches, and festivals are held around the world every year catering to players of all levels. 

Tournaments with a small number of players may use the round-robin format, in which every player plays one game against every other player. For a large number of players, the Swiss system may be used, in which each player is paired against an opponent who has the same (or as similar as possible) score in each round. In either case, a player's score is usually calculated as 1 point for each game won and one-half point for each game drawn. Variations such as "football scoring" (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw) may be used by tournament organizers, but ratings are 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess 11/37 always calculated on the basis of standard scoring. A player's score may be reported as total score out of games played (e.g. 5½/8), points for versus points 

against (e.g. 5½–2½), or by number of wins, losses and draws (e.g. +4−1=3). 

bes 

The term "match" refers not to an individual game, but to either a series of games 

between two players, or a team competition in which each player of one team 

plays one game against a player of the other team.

# Governance 

Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2019, 

Wijk aan Zee (the Netherlands) 

Chess's international governing body is usually known by its French acronym FIDE (pronounced FEE-day) (French: Fédération internationale des échecs), or International Chess Federation. FIDE's membership consists of the national chess organizations of over 180 countries; there are also several associate members, including various supra-national organizations, the International Braille Chess Association (IBCA), International Committee of Chess for the Deaf (ICCD), and the International Physically Disabled Chess Association (IPCA).[34] FIDE is recognized as a sports governing body by the International Olympic Committee,[35] but chess has never been part of the Olympic Games. 

FIDE's most visible activity is organizing the World Chess Championship, a role it assumed in 1948. The current World Champion is Gukesh Dommaraju of India.[36][37] The reigning Women's World Champion is Ju Wenjun from China.[38]

Other competitions for individuals include the World Junior Chess Championship, the 

European Individual Chess Championship, the tournaments for the World Championship qualification cycle, and the various national championships. Invitation- only tournaments regularly attract the world's strongest players. Examples include Spain's Linares event, Monte Carlo's Melody Amber tournament, the Dortmund Sparkassen meeting, Sofia's M-tel Masters, and Wijk aan Zee's Tata Steel tournament. 

Regular team chess events include the Chess Olympiad and the European Team Chess Championship. 

The World Chess Solving Championship and World Correspondence Chess 

Championships include both team and individual events; these are held independently of FIDE.

# Titles and rankings 

In order to rank players, FIDE, ICCF, and most national chess organizations use the Elo rating system developed by Arpad Elo. An average club player has a rating of about 1500; the highest FIDE rating of all time, 2882, was achieved by Magnus Carlsen on the March 2014 FIDE rating list.[39] 

Players may be awarded lifetime titles by FIDE:[41] 

Grandmaster (GM; sometimes International Grandmaster or IGM is used) is the highest title a chess player can attain. Before FIDE will confer the title on a player, the player must have had an Elo rating of 2500 or more at least once and must achieve three results of a prescribed standard (called norms) in tournaments involving other grandmasters, including some from countries other than the applicant's. There are other milestones that can substitute for norms, such as winning the World Junior Championship. 

International Master (IM). The conditions are similar to GM, but less demanding. The minimum rating for the IM title is 2400. 

FIDE Master (FM). The usual way for a player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving a FIDE rating of 2300 or more. 

Candidate Master (CM). Similar to FM, but with a FIDE rating of at least 2200. 

The above titles are known as "open" titles, obtainable by both men and women. There are also separate women-only titles; Woman Grandmaster (WGM), Woman International Master (WIM), Woman FIDE Master (WFM) and Woman Candidate Master (WCM). These require a performance level approximately 200 rating points below their respective open titles, and their continued existence has sometimes been controversial. Beginning with Nona Gaprindashvili in 1978, a number of women have earned the open GM title: 40 as of July 2023.[note 2] 

FIDE also awards titles for arbiters and trainers.[42][43] International titles are also awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems and to correspondence chess players (by the International Correspondence Chess Federation). National chess organizations may also award titles. 

# History 

## Origins 

Texts referring to the origins of chess date from the beginning of the seventh century. Three are written in Pahlavi (Middle Persian)[46] and one, the Harshacharita, is in Sanskrit.[47] One of these texts, the Chatrang-namak, represents one of the earliest written 

accounts of chess. The narrator Bozorgmehr explains that Chatrang, 

"Chess" in Pahlavi, was introduced to Persia by 'Dewasarm, a great ruler of India' during the reign of Khosrow I:[48] 

Dewasarm has fashioned this chatrang after the likeness of a battle, and in its likeness are two supreme rulers after the likeness of Kings (shah), with the essentials of rooks (rukh) 

to right and to left, with Counsellor (farzin) in the likeness 

of a commander of the champions, with the Elephant (pil) 

in the likeness of the commander of the rearguard, with 

Horse (asp) in the likeness of the commander of the cavalry, with the Footsoldier (piyadak) in the likeness of so many infantry in the vanguard of the battle

Maukhari King Śarvavarman of Kannauj, are 

playing chess. Shahnama, 10th century AD.[44][45] 

The oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to about 840, written by al-Adli ar-Rumi (800–870), a renowned Arab chess player, titled Kitab ash-shatranj (The Book of Chess). This is a lost manuscript, but is referenced in later works.[50] Here also, al-Adli attributes the origins of Persian chess to India, along with the eighth- century collection of fables Kalīla wa-Dimna.[51] By the 20th century, a substantial consensus[52][53] developed regarding chess's origins in northwest India in the early seventh century.[54] More recently, this consensus has been the subject of further scrutiny.[55] 

The early forms of chess in India were known as chaturaṅga (Sanskrit: चतुरङ), literally "four divisions" [of the military] – infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariotry – represented by pieces that would later evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively. Chaturanga was played on an 8×8 uncheckered board, called ashtāpada.[56] Thence it spread eastward and westward along the Silk Road. The earliest evidence of chess is found in nearby Sasanian Persia around 600 A.D., where the game came to be known by the name chatrang (Persian: ).[57] Chatrang was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia (633–51), where it was then named shatranj (Arabic: ; Persian: ), with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names. In Spanish, "shatranj" was rendered as ajedrez ("al-shatranj"), in Portuguese as xadrez, and in Greek as ζατρίκιον 

(zatrikion, which comes directly from the Persian chatrang),[58] but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian shāh ("king"), from which the English words "check" and "chess" descend.[note 3] The word "checkmate" is derived from the Persian shāh māt ("the king is dead").[59] 

Xiangqi is the form of chess best known in China. The eastern migration of chess, into China and Southeast Asia, has even less 

T 

documentation than its migration west, making it largely conjectured. The word xiàngqí (象棋) was used

directly related to chess.[60][61] The 

juegos, 1283 

first reference to Chinese chess 

appears in a book entitled Xuánguaì Lù (玄怪錄; "Record of the Mysterious and 

Strange"), dating to about 800. A minority view holds that Western chess arose 

from xiàngqí or one of its predecessors.[62][63] Chess historians Jean-Louis 

Cazaux and Rick Knowlton contend that xiangqi's intrinsic characteristics make 

it easier to construct an evolutionary path from China to India/Persia than the 

opposite direction.[64]

The oldest archaeological chess artifacts – ivory pieces – were excavated in ancient Afrasiab, today's Samarkand, in Uzbekistan, Central Asia, and date to about 760, with some of them possibly being older. Remarkably, almost all findings of the oldest pieces come from along the Silk Road, from the former regions of the Tarim Basin (today's Xinjiang in China), Transoxiana, Sogdiana, Bactria, Gandhara, to Iran on one end and to India through Kashmir on the other.[65] 

The game reached Western Europe and Russia via at least three routes, the earliest being in the ninth century. By the year 1000, it had spread throughout both the Muslim Iberia and Latin Europe.[67] A Latin poem called Versus de scachis ("Verses on Chess") dated to the late 10th century, has been preserved at Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland. 

## 1200–1700: Origins of the modern game 

The game of chess was then played and known in all European countries. A 

famous 13th-century Spanish manuscript covering chess, backgammon, and dice 

is known as the Libro de los juegos, which is the earliest European treatise on 

chess as well as being the oldest document on European tables games.[68] The 

rules were fundamentally similar to those of the Arabic shatranj. The differences 

were mostly in the use of a checkered board instead of a plain monochrome 

board used by Arabs and the habit of allowing some or all pawns to make an initial double step. In some regions, the queen, which had replaced the wazir, or the king could also make an initial two-square leap under some conditions.[69] 

These are some of the seven Early 

Islamic ivory chess pieces 

excavated in Samarkand in 1977. 

They date to the 700s and are 

among the oldest in the world.[66] 

The ivory came from India. 

Around 1200, the rules of shatranj started to be modified in Europe, culminating, several major changes later, in the emergence of modern chess practically as it is known today.[70] A major change was the modern piece movement rules, which began to appear in intellectual circles in Valencia, Spain, around 1475,[note 4] which established the foundations and brought it very close to current chess. These new rules then were quickly adopted in Italy and Southern France before diffusing into the rest of Europe.[73][74] Pawns gained the ability to advance two squares on their first move, while bishops and queens acquired their modern movement powers. The queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece toward the end of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece;[75] in light of that, modern chess was often referred to at the time as "Queen's Chess" or 

"Mad Queen Chess".[76] Castling, derived from the "king's leap", usually in combination with a pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety, was introduced. These new rules quickly spread throughout Western Europe.

openings and the second 30 endgames is deposited in the library of the University of Göttingen.[77] The book El Libro dels jochs partitis dels schachs en 

A tactical puzzle from Lucena's 1497 book 

nombre de 100 was written by Francesc Vicent in Segorbe in 1495, but no copy of this work has survived.[77] The Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez 

(Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess) by Spanish churchman Luis Ramírez de Lucena was published in Salamanca in 1497.[74] Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano, Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona, Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco, and Spanish bishop Ruy López de Segura developed elements of opening theory and started to analyze simple endgames. 

## 1700–1873: Romantic era 

In the 18th century, the center of European chess life moved from Southern 

Europe to mainland France. The two most important French masters were 

François-André Danican Philidor, a musician by profession, who discovered 

the importance of pawns for chess strategy, and later Louis-Charles Mahé de 

La Bourdonnais, who won a famous series of matches against Irish master Alexander McDonnell in 1834.[78] Centers of chess activity in this period were 

coffee houses in major European cities like Café de la Régence in Paris and 

Simpson's Divan in London.[79][80]

At the same time, the intellectual movement of romanticism had had a far-

The "Immortal Game", Anderssen vs. 

unsportsmanlike to decline gambits that invited tactical play such as the 

Kieseritzky, 1851 

King's Gambit and the Evans Gambit.[81] This chess philosophy is known as Romantic chess, and a sharp, tactical style consistent with the principles of chess romanticism was predominant until the late 19th century.[82] 

The rules concerning stalemate were finalized in the early 19th century. Also in the 19th century, the convention that White moves first was established (formerly either White or Black could move first). Finally, the rules around castling and en passant captures were standardized – variations in these rules persisted in Italy until the late 19th century. The resulting standard game is sometimes referred to as Western chess[83] or international chess,[84] particularly in Asia where other games of the chess family such as xiangqi are prevalent. Since the 19th century, the only rule changes, such as the establishment of the correct procedure for claiming a draw by repetition, have been technical in nature. 

As the 19th century progressed, chess organization developed quickly. Many chess clubs, chess books, and chess journals appeared. There were correspondence matches between cities; for example, the London Chess Club played against the Edinburgh Chess Club in 1824.[85] Chess problems became a regular part of 19th-century newspapers; Bernhard Horwitz, Josef Kling, and Samuel Loyd composed some of the most influential problems. In 1843, von der Lasa published his and Bilguer's Handbuch des Schachspiels (Handbook of Chess), the first comprehensive manual of chess theory.
