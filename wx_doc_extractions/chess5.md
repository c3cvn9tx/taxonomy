Chess - WikipediaDuring the Age of Enlightenment, chess was viewed as a means of self-improvement. Benjamin Franklin, in his article "The Morals of Chess" (1786), wrote: 

The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement; several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired and strengthened by it, so as to become habits ready on all occasions; for life is a kind of Chess, in which we have often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effect of prudence, or the want of it. By playing at Chess then, we may learn: 

I. Foresight, which looks a little into futurity, and considers the consequences that may attend an action ... 

* II. Circumspection, which surveys the whole Chess-board, or scene of action: – the relation of the several Pieces, and their situations ...
* III. Caution, not to make our moves too hastily ...[137]

Chess was occasionally criticized in the 19th century as a waste of time.[138][139] 

Chess is taught to children in schools around the world today. Many schools host chess clubs, and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children. Tournaments are held regularly in many countries, hosted by 

organizations such as the United States Chess Federation and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation.[140]

key role range from Thomas Middleton's A Game at Chess to Through the

Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll, to Vladimir Nabokov's The Defense, to The Royal Game by Stefan Zweig. Chess has also featured in film classics such as Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal, Satyajit Ray's The Chess Players, and Powell and Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death. 

Chess is also present in contemporary popular culture. For example, the characters in Star Trek play a futuristic version of the game called "Federation Tri-Dimensional Chess",[141] and "Wizard's Chess" is played in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter.[142] 

# Mathematics 

The game structure and nature of chess are related to several branches of mathematics. Many combinatorical and topological problems connected to chess, such as the knight's tour and the eight queens puzzle, have been known for hundreds of years. 

The number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be (4.59 ± 0.38) × 1044 with a 95% confidence level,[143] with a game-tree complexity of approximately 10123. The game-tree complexity of chess was first calculated by Claude Shannon as 10120, a number known as the Shannon number.[144] An average position typically has thirty to forty possible moves, but there may be as few as zero (in the case of checkmate or stalemate) or (in a constructed position) as many as 218.[145] 

In 1913, Ernst Zermelo used chess as a basis for his theory of game strategies, which is considered one of the predecessors of game theory.[146] Zermelo's theorem states that it is possible to solve chess, i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game (either White can force a win, or Black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw).[147] With 1043 legal positions in chess, however, it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology.[148] 

# Psychology 

There is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology.[note 6][150][151][152][153] Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal, rather than visuospatial, ability lies at the core of expertise.[154][155] In his doctoral thesis, Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position.[156] According to de Groot, this perception, made possible by years of practice and study, is 

Mathematicians Euler, 

more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess 

Legendre, de Moivre, and 

masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability

to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, 

knight's tour. 

when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about six positions in each case). Rather, it is the ability to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.[157] 

More recent research has focused on chess as mental training; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices; blindfold chess; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much empirical investigation. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess.[158] Recent research, however, fails to replicate their results and indicates that factors other than practice are also important.[159][160] For example, Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere are more likely to have been born in late winter and early spring. Compared to the general population, chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.[160] 

A relationship between chess skill and intelligence has long been discussed in scientific literature as well as in popular culture. Academic studies that investigate the relationship date back at least to 1927.[161] Although one meta- analysis and most children studies find a positive correlation between general cognitive ability and chess skill, adult studies show mixed results.[162][163] 

# Compositions and puzzles 

## Compositions 

Chess composition is the art of creating chess problems (also called chess compositions). The creator is known as a chess composer.[165] There are many types of chess problems; the two most important are: 

Directmates: White to move and checkmate Black within a specified number of moves, against any defense. These are often referred to as "mate in n" – for example "mate in three"; two, and three move problems are common. Directmates usually consist of positions unlikely to occur in an actual game, and are intended to illustrate a particular theme, usually requiring a surprising or counterintuitive key move. Themes associated with chess problems occasionally appear in actual games, when they are referred to as "problem-like" moves.[166] Studies: orthodox problems where the stipulation is that White to play must win or draw. The majority of studies are endgame positions.[167] 

Fairy chess is a branch of chess problem composition involving altered rules, such as the use of unconventional pieces or boards, or unusual stipulations such as reflexmates. 

Tournaments for composition and solving of chess problems are organized by 

the World Federation for Chess Composition, which works cooperatively with but independent of FIDE. The WFCC awards titles for composing and solving 

chess problems. [168]

Puzzles 

A chess puzzle is a position presented with the goal of finding the best move 

and continuation for the side to play. Puzzles are usually positions taken from 

actual games, or from analysis of actual games, rather than composed positions. They are commonly used for tactical training, as the solution 

typically involves a combination ending in checkmate, decisive advantage, or 

successful defense. Many chess sites offer puzzles.

Online chess 

This Réti endgame study is solved by 

Online chess is chess played over the internet. This is done through the use of 

advancing the white king diagonally to bring it to both pawns simultaneously, 

internet chess platforms, which use Elo ratings or similar systems to pair up 

stopping the black pawn and supporting 

individual players. Online chess saw a spike in growth during the quarantines 

the white pawn on its way to queen, [164] 

of the COVID-19 pandemic. [169][170] This can be attributed to both isolation and the popularity of Netflix miniseries The Queen's Gambit, which was released in October 2020,[169][170] Chess app downloads on the App Store and Google Play Store rose by 63% after the show debuted.[17] Chess.com saw more than twice as many account registrations in November as it had in previous months, and the number of games played monthly on Lichess doubled as well. There was also a demographic shift in players, with female registration on Chess.com shifting from 22% to 27% of new players.[172] GM Maurice Ashley said "A boom is taking place in chess like we have never seen maybe since the Bobby Fischer days", attributing the growth to an increased desire to do something constructive during the pandemic [173] USCF Women's Program Director Jennifer Shahade stated that chess works well on the internet, since pieces do not need to be reset and matchmaking is virtually instant. [174] 

Computer chess 

The idea of creating a chess-playing machine dates to the 18th century; around 1769, the chess-playing automaton called The Turk became famous before being exposed as a hoax,[175] Serious trials based on automata, such as El Ajedrecista, were too complex and limited to be useful. Since the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s, chess enthusiasts, computer engineers, and computer scientists have built, with increasing degrees of seriousness and success, chess-playing machines and computer programs.[176] The groundbreaking paper on computer chess, "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess", was published in 1950 by Claude Shannon [note 7l He wrote: 

The chess machine is an ideal one to start with, since: (1) the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations (the moves) and in the ultimate goal (checkmate); (2) it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution; (3) chess is generally considered to require "thinking" for skillful play; a solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of a mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of "thinking"; (4) the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature of modern computers. [178] 

The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) held the first major chess tournament for computers, the North American Computer Chess Championship, in September 1970. CHESS 3.0, a chess program from Northwestern University, won the championship. The first World Computer Chess Championship, held in 1974, was won by the Soviet program Kaissa. At first considered only a curiosity, the best chess playing programs have become extremely https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess 23/37 strong. In 1997, a computer won a chess match using classical time controls against a reigning World Champion for the first time: IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov 3½–2½ (it scored two wins, one loss, and three draws).[179][180] There was some controversy over the match,[181] and human–computer matches 

were relatively close over the next few years, until convincing computer victories in 2005 and in 2006.

With huge databases of past games and high analytical ability, computers can help players to learn chess and prepare for matches. Internet Chess Servers allow people to find and play opponents worldwide. The presence of computers and modern communication tools have raised concerns regarding cheating during games.[187]

There are more than two thousand published chess variants, games with similar but different rules.[190] Most of them are of relatively recent origin.[191] They 

include: 

modern variations employing different rules (e.g. losing chess and Chess960[note 8]), different forces (e.g. Dunsany's chess), non-standard pieces (e.g. Grand Chess), and different board geometries (e.g. hexagonal chess and infinite chess); 

In the context of chess variants, chess is commonly referred to as orthodox chess, orthochess, and classic chess.[188][189]
