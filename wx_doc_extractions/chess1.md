Chess - Wikipedia# Chess 

Chess is a board game for two players. It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from 

related games such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). 

Chess is an abstract strategy game which involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played on a square game 

board called a chessboard containing 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The players, referred to as "White" and "Black", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black; then 

moves alternate. The object of the game is to checkmate (threaten with inescapable capture) the enemy king. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw. 

The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a 

similar game, chaturanga, in seventh-century India. After its 

introduction in Persia, it spread to the Arab world and then to Europe. 

The modern rules of chess emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th 

century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of 

the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular 

games, with millions of players worldwide.

Organized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is 

governed internationally by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des 

Échecs; the International Chess Federation). The first universally 

recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Gukesh Dommaraju is the current World Champion (2024).

#### Western chess 

A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception. 

Aspects of art are found in chess composition, and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and the arts, and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology. One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat a reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory; however, chess is not a solved game.

# Rules 

The rules of chess are published by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Echecs; "International Chess Federation"), chess's world governing body, in its Handbook.[2] Rules published by national governing bodies, or by unaffiliated chess organizations, commercial publishers, etc., may differ in some details. FIDE's rules were most recently revised in 2023. 

Setup 

Chess sets come in a wide variety of styles. The Staunton pattern is the most common, and is usually required for competition.[3] Chess sets come with pieces in two colors, referred to as white and black, regardless of their actual color; the - inflatizly 

players controlling the color sets are referred to as White and Black, respectively. Each set comes with at least the following 16 pieces in both colors: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. [2] 

Setup at the start of a chess game 

The game is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks) and eight columns (called files). Under algebraic notation, files are lettered a through h and ranks are numbered 1 through 8 (or first through eighth). Squares are identified as coordinate pairs of the file and rank they occur on; h8 is the square on the h-file and the eighth rank. (See 

* § Notation.) Although it does not affect game play, by convention the 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares.[2] Common colors for wooden chessboards are light and dark brown, while vinyl chessboards are commonly buff and green. To start the game, White's pieces are placed on the first rank in the following 

order, from left to right: rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight, 

rook. Pawns are placed on each square of the second rank. Black's position mirrors White's, with equivalent pieces on every file.[2] The board is oriented 

so that the right-hand corner nearest each player is a light square; as a result 

the white queen always starts on a light square, while the black queen starts 

on a dark square. This may be remembered by the phrases "white on the 

right" and "queen on her color" . \_4] 

In formal competition, the piece colors for every matchup are allocated to 

players by the organizers. In informal games, colors may be decided either by 

mutual agreement, or randomly, for example by a coin toss, or by one player 

concealing a white pawn in one hand and a black pawn in the other and 

having the opponent choose.

Initial position: first row: rook, knight.

Movement 

White moves first, after which players alternate turns. One piece is moved per turn (except when castling, during which two pieces are moved). In the diagrams, dots mark the squares to which each type of piece can move if unoccupied by friendly pieces and there are no intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps over any intervening pieces). With the sole exception of en passant, a piece captures an enemy piece by moving to the square it occupies, removing it from play and taking its place. The pawn is the only piece that does not capture the way it moves, and it is the only piece that moves and captures in only one direction (forwards from the player's perspective). A piece is said to control empty squares on which it could capture, attack squares with enemy pieces it could capture, and defend squares with pieces of the same color on which it could recapture. Moving is compulsory; a player may not skip a turn, even when having to move is detrimental.

The king moves one square in any direction. There is also a special move called castling which moves the king and a rook. The king is the most valuable piece -it is illegal to play any move that puts one 's king under attack by an opponent piece. A move that attacks the king must be parried immediately; if this cannot be done, the game is lost. (See § Check and checkmate.) 

A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file. A rook is involved in the king's castling move. Abishop can move any number of squares diagonally. 

A queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal. 

A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.) The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces. 

A pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can optionally advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied (diagram dots). A pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square (diagram crosses). It cannot capture a piece while advancing along the same file, nor can it move to either square diagonally in front without capturing. Pawns have two special moves: the en passant capture and promotion. 

Check and checkmate 

When a king is under immediate attack, it is in check. A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position in which the king is no longer in check. There are three ways to counter a check: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess 3/37 

Capture the checking piece. 

Interpose a piece between the checking 

piece and the king (possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop 

and there is a square between it and the 

king). 

Move the king to a square where it is not 

under attack. 

The object of the game is to checkmate the 

opponent; this occurs when the opponent's 

king is in check, and there is no legal way to 

get it out of check. In casual games, it is 

common to announce "check" when putting 

the opponent's king in check, but this is not 

required by the rules of chess and is usually not done in tournaments [5]

Castling 

Kings can castle once per game. Castling consists of moving the king two squares 

toward either rook of the same color, and then placing the rook on the square that 

the king crossed. 

Castling is possible only if the following conditions are met: [2] 

Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved during the game. 

There are no pieces between the king and the rook. 

The king is not in check and does not pass through or finish on a square 

controlled by an enemy piece. 

Castling is still permitted if the rook is under attack, or if the rook crosses an 

attacked square. 

Special pawn moves 

Pawns have two special moves: 

En passant: when a pawn makes a two-square advance to the same rank as 

an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file, that pawn can capture it en passant 

("in passing"), moving to one square behind the captured pawn. A pawn can 

only be captured en passant on the turn after it makes a two-square advance. 

In the animated diagram, the black pawn advances two squares from g7 to g5, 

and the white pawn on f5 takes it en passant, landing on g6. Promotion: when a pawn advances to its last rank, it is promoted and replaced 

with the player's choice of a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. Usually, pawns are 

promoted to queens; choosing another piece is called underpromotion. In the 

animated diagram, the c7-pawn is advanced to c8 and promoted to a queen. If 

the required piece is not available (e.g. a second queen), an inverted rook is 

sometimes used as a substitute, but this is not recognized in FIDE-sanctioned 

games.

End of the game 

Win 

A game can be won in the following ways: 

Checkmate: The opposing king is in check and the opponent has no legal move. (See § Check and checkmate.) 

Resignation: A player may resign, conceding the game to the opponent.[6] If, however, the opponent has no way of checkmating the resigned player, this is a draw under FIDE Laws.[2] Most tournament players consider it good etiquette to resign in a hopeless position.[7][8] 

Win on time: In games with a time control, a player wins if the opponent runs out of time, even if the opponent has a superior position, as long as the player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent were the game to continue. 

Forfeit: A player who cheats, violates the rules, or violates the rules of conduct specified for the particular tournament can be forfeited. Occasionally, both players are forfeited.[2]

## Draw 

There are several ways a game can end in a draw: 

Stalemate: If the player to move has no legal move, but is not in check, the position is a stalemate, and the game is drawn. 

Dead position: If neither player is able to checkmate the other by any legal sequence of moves, the game is drawn. For example, if only the kings are on the board, all other pieces having been captured, checkmate is impossible, and the game is drawn by this rule. On the other hand, if both players still have a knight, there is a highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate, so this rule does not apply. The dead position rule supersedes an older rule which referred to "insufficient material", extending it to include other positions where checkmate is impossible, such as blocked pawn endings where the pawns cannot be attacked. 

Draw by agreement: In tournament chess, draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, make a move, then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally, players have been allowed to agree to a draw at any point in the game, occasionally even without playing a move. More recently efforts have been made to discourage early draws, for example by forbidding draw offers before a certain point. 

Threefold repetition: This most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. The addition of the fivefold repetition rule in 2014 requires the arbiter to intervene immediately and declare the game a draw after five occurrences of the same position, consecutive or otherwise, without requiring a claim by either player. FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check; this is merely a specific type of draw by threefold repetition. 

Fifty-move rule: If during the previous 50 moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made, either player can claim a draw. The addition of the seventy-five-move rule in 2014 requires the arbiter to intervene and immediately declare the game drawn after 75 moves without a pawn move or capture, without requiring a claim by either player. There are several known endgames where it is possible to force a mate but it requires more than 50 moves before a pawn move or capture is made; examples include some endgames with two knights against a pawn and some pawnless endgames such as queen against two bishops. Historically, FIDE has sometimes revised the fifty-move rule to make exceptions for these endgames, but these have since been repealed. Some correspondence chess organizations do not enforce the fifty-move rule.[note 1] 

Draw on time: In games with a time control, the game is drawn if a player is out of time and no sequence of legal moves would allow the opponent to checkmate the player.[2] 

Draw by resignation: Under FIDE Laws, a game is drawn if a player resigns and no sequence of legal moves would allow the opponent to checkmate that player.[2]
